# NoSQL_Amazone
The project is to design, implement and demonstrate a NoSQL database for the Amazone online shopping website that operates only in the UK. Amazone has decided to expand its operations by delivering fresh groceries. Amazone partnered with Morrizon, a UK grocery retailer, to offer same-day and instant grocery delivery service. Amazone has decided to experiment with same-day and instant grocery delivery using Manchester. Six Morrizon grocery stores have been chosen for instant pick-up and delivery by delivery drivers who are Amazon partners.
